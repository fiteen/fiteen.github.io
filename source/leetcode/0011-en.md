---

English ｜ [简体中文](leetcode/0011)



## Q

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example:**

>**Input:** [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
>**Output:** 49



## A

```swift
class Solution {
    func maxArea(_ height: [Int]) -> Int {
        var i = 0, j = height.count - 1, area = 0
        while i < j {
            area = max(area, min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i))
            if height[i] < height[j] {
                i += 1
            } else {
                j -= 1
            }
        }
        return area
    }
}
```
