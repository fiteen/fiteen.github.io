title: 0026. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
---

English ｜ [简体中文](leetcode/0026)



## Q

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

>Given nums = **[1,1,2]**,
>
>Your function should return length = **2**, with the first two elements of nums being **1** and **2** respectively.
>
>It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

**Example 2:**

>Given *nums* = **[0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]**,
>
>Your function should return length = **5**, with the first five elements of *nums* being modified to **0, 1, 2, 3,** and **4** respectively.
>
>It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// **nums** is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to **nums** in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first **len** elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```



## A

```swift
class Solution {
    func removeDuplicates(_ nums: inout [Int]) -> Int {
        if nums.count == 0 {
            return 0
        }
        var i = 0
        for num in nums {
            if nums[i] != num {
                i += 1
                nums[i] = num
            }
        }
        return i + 1
    }
}
```
